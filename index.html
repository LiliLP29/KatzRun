<h2 class="abt1">About Katz Run</h2>

<p class="abt2">Katz run is a very simple, 2D game made on Game Maker and published on itch.io. Essentially, the main character, Mr Katz, runs through school hallways while jumping and avoiding the many obstacles that he encounters in his path. Our inspiration for Katz run is a mix of the dinosaur game on google and our design teacher, Mr. Katz. Our goal was to make a game that you can play when you're bored without using too much brain power.</p>
